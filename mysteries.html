                        <p>Marc Spector was a mercenary left for dead in the Egyptian desert near an archaeological dig site. Dying beneath a statue of Khonshu, the ancient Egyptian god of the moon and vengeance, Marc was offered a second chance. Khonshu resurrected him to become his earthly avatar—the Moon Knight.</p>
                        <p>As Moon Knight, Marc possesses enhanced strength that waxes and wanes with the lunar cycle, reaching peak power under the full moon. But the blessing came with a price: Marc's mind fractured, creating multiple identities including Steven Grant, a wealthy entrepreneur, and Jake Lockley, a streetwise cab driver. Some believe these personalities are manifestations of Marc's dissociative identity disorder; others whisper they are aspects of Khonshu himself, living through his mortal host.</p>
                        <p>The moon god's chosen protector now stalks the night, dispensing brutal justice to those who prey upon travelers and the vulnerable. Yet Marc constantly questions whether his mission serves true justice or merely satisfies an ancient deity's thirst for vengeance. The line between divine purpose and madness blurs with each passing moon.</p>

                        <p>In the dawn of Egyptian civilization, when the pantheon of gods walked among mortals, Khonshu emerged as the divine embodiment of the moon. Known as "the Traveler" for his nightly journey across the heavens, he was revered as a protector of night travelers and a fierce defender against creatures of darkness.</p>
                        <p>Born of Amon-Ra, the king of gods, Khonshu chose a different path from his solar father. While Ra brought life-giving light, Khonshu illuminated the hidden truths that lurk in shadow. Ancient texts describe him with a hawk's head crowned by the crescent moon, or as a mummy wrapped in silver linens that gleamed like moonlight.</p>
                        <p>Khonshu was both healer and destroyer—his temples served as sanctuaries where priests performed miraculous cures under the full moon, yet he was also called upon to deliver vengeance against those who committed crimes under cover of night. The ancient Egyptians believed he could chase away evil spirits and possessed the power to influence human destiny, marking some mortals as his chosen instruments of justice.</p>

                        <p>Born in secrecy to Osiris and Nephthys, Anubis emerged as one of Egypt's oldest and most revered deities. With the head of a jackal and the body of a man, he became the divine guardian of tombs and guide of souls through the treacherous journey to the afterlife.</p>
                        <p>It was Anubis who first performed the sacred ritual of mummification, perfecting the art on the body of his slain father Osiris. This act established him as the patron of embalmers and the protector of the deceased. In the Hall of Two Truths, Anubis performs the Weighing of the Heart ceremony—placing the deceased's heart on one side of a scale, balanced against the feather of Ma'at, symbol of truth and justice. A heart heavy with sin would be devoured by Ammit; a light heart granted passage to paradise.</p>
                        <p>Ancient Egyptians painted their tombs with his image, believing his presence would ward off grave robbers and malevolent spirits. Priests wearing jackal masks performed funeral rites in his name, and offerings were left at his shrines to ensure safe passage for the departed. Even in death, Anubis remains the compassionate guide leading souls through eternal darkness into light.</p>

                        <p>In the beginning, there was only Nun—the infinite waters of chaos. From these primordial depths, Ra willed himself into existence, emerging as the first sunrise. With his first breath, he exhaled Shu (air) and Tefnut (moisture), beginning the creation of the world. His tears became the first humans; his words became reality itself.</p>
                        <p>Each day, Ra journeys across the sky in his solar barque, the Mandjet, bringing light and life to all existence. But his voyage does not end with sunset—at dusk, he enters the underworld, sailing through twelve hours of darkness in the Mesektet barque, battling the chaos serpent Apophis who seeks to devour the sun and plunge the world into eternal night. Each dawn is his victory, a promise that order will triumph over chaos.</p>
                        <p>As Ra aged, he merged with other deities—becoming Amon-Ra, the king of all gods. Yet his power came with loneliness; he ruled from the heavens while his creations, both divine and mortal, lived out their struggles below. The Egyptians built grand temples at Heliopolis where his priests tended the sacred flame, ensuring the sun god's favor and the continuation of existence itself.</p>

                        <div class="story-divider"></div>
                        <p>Kratos was born a Spartan warrior, trained in brutality and warfare from childhood. His skill in battle was unmatched, but ambition and rage drove him to make a fateful pact. On the brink of defeat against barbarian hordes, Kratos called upon Ares, the God of War, pledging his soul in exchange for victory. Ares answered, binding the Blades of Chaos to Kratos's flesh and transforming him into a living weapon.</p>
                        <p>But divine gifts come with terrible costs. In his blood-drunk fury, manipulated by Ares, Kratos slaughtered his own wife and daughter. Their ashes were cursed to cling to his skin forever, marking him as "the Ghost of Sparta"—pale as death, haunted by the screams of those he loved. Consumed by guilt and rage, Kratos turned his blades against the gods themselves.</p>
                        <p>His vengeance knew no limits. He slew Ares and claimed the throne of the God of War. When Zeus betrayed him, Kratos waged war on all of Olympus, killing gods and titans alike, leaving only ruins in his wake. Yet even as a god, he could not escape his mortality—the humanity that made him both powerful and vulnerable. His journey from mortal warrior to divine destroyer reshaped the very fabric of Greek mythology.</p>

                    <div class="full-story">

                        <p>Zeus's story began with prophecy and fear. His father, the titan Cronus, had overthrown his own father Uranus and heard a dire prediction: he would be overthrown by his own child. Paranoid, Cronus swallowed each of his children whole as they were born. But his wife Rhea could not bear to lose another child. When Zeus was born, she hid him in a cave on Crete, giving Cronus a stone wrapped in swaddling clothes instead.</p>
                        <p>Raised in secret by nymphs and fed on the milk of the goat Amalthea, Zeus grew strong and wise. When he reached manhood, he returned to face his father. With cunning worthy of his future reign, Zeus forced Cronus to regurgitate his siblings—Hestia, Demeter, Hera, Hades, and Poseidon. United, the young gods waged the Titanomachy, a ten-year war against the titans. Zeus, wielding thunderbolts forged by the Cyclopes, led his siblings to victory and cast the titans into Tartarus.</p>
                        <p>As king of Olympus, Zeus became god of the sky, thunder, and justice—though his reign was marked by both wisdom and capricious passion. He fathered countless heroes and gods, each inheriting a portion of his divine power. Yet his authority was constantly challenged by rebellious gods, vengeful titans, and even his own children. The throne Zeus fought so hard to claim would never grant him peace, for the cycle of sons overthrowing fathers is eternal.</p>

                        <p>Athena's birth defied all natural law. Zeus had swallowed her mother Metis, goddess of wisdom, after learning a prophecy that their child might overthrow him. But the unborn Athena could not be contained. She grew within Zeus's skull, her divine essence hammering away at his mind until the god-king suffered splitting headaches that threatened to drive him mad.</p>
                        <p>Finally, Zeus commanded Hephaestus to split his head open with an axe. From the wound sprang Athena, fully grown and clad in golden armor, her war cry shaking the heavens. She was wisdom personified—inheriting Metis's cunning and Zeus's authority, but tempering both with reason and justice. Unlike Ares, who reveled in battle's chaos, Athena embodied strategic warfare and righteous defense.</p>
                        <p>She became patron of Athens after besting Poseidon in a contest, gifting the city an olive tree—symbol of peace and prosperity—over the sea god's salt water spring. Heroes sought her guidance, and she answered, blessing Odysseus with cunning, Perseus with a mirrored shield, and Heracles with wisdom to complete his labors. In temples across Greece, her devotees offered sacrifices not for victory in battle, but for the wisdom to avoid war altogether. Yet when war came, no deity was more formidable than grey-eyed Athena, the goddess who turned the tide of the Trojan War with nothing more than a clever stratagem.</p>

                        <p>Born to Zeus and Hera as their legitimate son, Ares should have been the pride of Olympus. Instead, he became its most despised resident. Where other gods sought glory and honor, Ares craved only the screams of the dying and the stench of spilled blood. He was the savage face of war—not the noble, strategic conflict Athena represented, but the mindless slaughter that consumed armies and left only corpses.</p>
                        <p>The Greeks feared and reviled him in equal measure. They built few temples in his honor, offered reluctant sacrifices, and whispered that even his own parents found him repulsive. Zeus called him "the most hateful of all gods," and other deities avoided him. Yet when warriors fell into battle frenzy, losing themselves to bloodlust, they were said to be possessed by Ares's spirit. His chariot, pulled by fire-breathing horses named Phobos (Fear) and Deimos (Terror), thundered across battlefields leaving madness in its wake.</p>
                        <p>Despite his fearsome power, Ares was often defeated—by Athena's superior strategy, by mortal heroes guided by wiser gods, even by being trapped in a bronze jar for thirteen months by the giant Aloadae twins. His greatest shame came during the Trojan War when the mortal Diomedes, aided by Athena, drove a spear into him, forcing the god to flee to Olympus in humiliation. Yet Ares endured, for as long as mankind wages war, the god of bloodshed will never truly die.</p>

                        <p>Poseidon was among the children Cronus swallowed, trapped in the titan's belly until Zeus freed him. When the Olympians divided the cosmos after defeating the titans, Poseidon received dominion over all waters—seas, rivers, lakes, and the creatures within them. His palace beneath the Aegean Sea was said to rival Olympus in splendor, crafted from coral and precious gems that glittered in the deep.</p>
                        <p>With his three-pronged trident—forged by the Cyclopes during the war against the titans—Poseidon could summon storms, create earthquakes, and split mountains. Sailors and coastal cities made constant offerings to appease him, for his wrath was legendary. When Athens chose Athena over him as patron deity, Poseidon flooded the surrounding plains in rage. When King Minos of Crete refused to sacrifice a sacred bull, Poseidon drove the king's wife to madness, resulting in the birth of the Minotaur.</p>
                        <p>Yet Poseidon was not merely a god of destruction. He gave mankind the horse—some myths say he created it, others that he could transform into an equine form himself. He protected sailors who honored him and drowned those who showed hubris. His many children included both heroes like Theseus and monsters like Polyphemus the Cyclops. Like the sea itself, Poseidon was unpredictable: calm and generous one moment, raging and deadly the next. Mortals learned to fear and respect the god who held their fates in his hands each time they ventured upon the wine-dark sea.</p>

                        <p>As the eldest son of Cronus and Rhea, Hades was the first swallowed by his father and the last regurgitated. When the Olympians defeated the titans and divided creation, Hades drew the shortest lot—rule over the underworld, the realm of the dead. While his brothers Zeus and Poseidon received glorious dominions of sky and sea, Hades was consigned to eternal darkness.</p>
                        <p>Yet Hades accepted his fate with quiet dignity. His realm was vast and terrible—the river Styx marked its border, ferried across by Charon for the price of a single coin. Three-headed Cerberus guarded the gates, allowing souls to enter but never leave. Within lay the Fields of Asphodel where ordinary souls wandered, the Elysian Fields where heroes dwelt in eternal bliss, and Tartarus where the wicked suffered eternal punishment.</p>
                        <p>Unlike the dramatic gods of Olympus, Hades ruled with stern but fair judgment. He was called Plouton ("the wealthy one") for the precious metals and gems hidden beneath the earth. His most famous act was the abduction of Persephone, daughter of Demeter—a deed that brought winter to the world when the grieving goddess made nothing grow. Yet in time, Persephone became queen of the underworld, and their marriage, though born of violence, mellowed into genuine partnership. Hades rarely left his realm, content to rule over death while his brothers squabbled over the living. In the end, his kingdom would claim them all.</p>

                        <p>Osiris was born during the five epagomenal days—time outside time, created by the god Thoth to allow the sky goddess Nut to bear children despite Ra's curse. As the eldest, Osiris inherited the throne of Egypt, bringing civilization, agriculture, and law to humanity. His rule was a golden age; he taught mortals to cultivate wheat and barley, to brew beer, and to live by ma'at—truth, justice, and cosmic order.</p>
                        <p>But his brother Set harbored dark envy. During a feast, Set unveiled a magnificent chest, promising it to whoever fit inside perfectly. When Osiris, measured beforehand, climbed in, Set slammed the lid shut and sealed it with molten lead. He cast the chest into the Nile, where it drifted to the distant land of Byblos. Osiris's grieving wife Isis searched tirelessly, finally retrieving his body—only for Set to steal it again, this time dismembering Osiris into fourteen pieces scattered across Egypt.</p>
                        <p>Isis and her sister Nephthys gathered the fragments (all but one, devoured by a fish), and with Anubis's help, performed the first mummification. Isis's love and magic were so powerful she briefly resurrected Osiris, conceiving their son Horus before Osiris descended to rule Duat, the Egyptian underworld. There he sits enthroned in the Hall of Two Truths, his skin green like rebirth, judging souls who seek passage to the afterlife. Osiris proved that death is not an ending but a transformation—a promise that sustained Egyptian civilization for three millennia.</p>

                        <p>Born alongside her siblings during the five epagomenal days, Isis grew to become the most powerful magician in existence. Her devotion to her husband Osiris was legendary—when Set murdered him, Isis transformed into a kite and flew across Egypt searching for his body. Her determination restored him to life long enough to conceive Horus, and her magic protected their son in the marshes of the Nile Delta while he grew strong enough to avenge his father.</p>
                        <p>Isis's magical prowess was so great she tricked Ra himself. In his old age, Ra drooled, and Isis collected his spittle to create a magical serpent. When it bit Ra, causing him terrible pain, only Isis could heal him—but she demanded his true name, the source of his power, as payment. With Ra's secret name, Isis became one of the most powerful deities in the pantheon.</p>
                        <p>As "Goddess of Ten Thousand Names," Isis embodied many roles: faithful wife, devoted mother, skilled healer, and keeper of secret knowledge. Her worship spread beyond Egypt to Greece and Rome, where she was revered as Isis Myrionymos—the goddess of countless names—syncretizing with other divine figures. Women prayed to her for protection during childbirth; sailors invoked her for safe voyages; the sick sought her healing touch. Her promise was one of hope: that love and magic could overcome even death itself.</p>

                        <p>Conceived miraculously after Osiris's death, Horus was hidden by Isis in the papyrus marshes of Khemmis, protected from his uncle Set's wrath by goddesses and magical spells. As he grew, Isis taught him both warfare and wisdom, preparing him for the day he would claim his birthright—the throne of Egypt stolen by Set through murder and treachery.</p>
                        <p>When Horus came of age, he challenged Set before the council of gods. What followed was an epic contest lasting eighty years. The rivals transformed into hippopotami and battled underwater; they raced in boats of stone; they engaged in tests of strength and cunning. During one battle, Set tore out Horus's left eye—but the god Thoth restored it, and the Eye of Horus became a symbol of healing and protection throughout Egypt.</p>
                        <p>Finally, Osiris himself testified from the underworld, and the gods ruled in Horus's favor. Set was cast into the desert to become god of storms and chaos, while Horus claimed the throne. Every pharaoh thereafter was considered Horus incarnate, the living god-king who maintained ma'at. Horus's falcon eyes watched over Egypt—his right eye the blazing sun, his left the gentle moon. In temples and tombs, his image stood eternal vigil, the divine protector whose victory over Set ensured that order would always triumph over chaos, that justice would outlast treachery, that light would always break through the longest night.</p>

                        <p>Set was born violently, tearing himself from his mother Nut's womb before his time. This brutal birth foreshadowed his nature—a god of strength, storms, and the untamed desert. His form was strange even among deities: a curved snout, tall rectangular ears, and a forked tail belonging to no known creature. Where Osiris represented fertile Egypt, Set embodied the harsh desert that surrounded it—necessary but dangerous, powerful but chaotic.</p>
                        <p>His murder of Osiris was not merely fratricide but cosmic rebellion. Set could not accept being second, living in his brother's shadow while Osiris ruled the Black Land. The murder, dismemberment, and usurpation of the throne revealed Set's fundamental nature: he was isfet incarnate—chaos, disorder, the force that challenged ma'at. Yet ancient Egyptians also revered him as protector of Ra's solar barque, for each night Set stood at the prow battling the chaos serpent Apophis, his chaotic nature the perfect weapon against even greater chaos.</p>
                        <p>After losing the throne to Horus, Set was exiled to the desert, becoming god of foreigners, violence, and storms. Some pharaohs embraced him as a warrior deity; others vilified him as pure evil. Set existed in the liminal spaces—neither wholly evil nor good, but the necessary chaos that defines the boundaries of order. Without Set, there could be no Horus; without chaos, no meaning to order. He was the storm that tests, the desert that transforms, the adversary who makes heroes of those who overcome him.</p>

                        <p>Born to Zeus and the mortal princess Alcmene, Hercules inherited strength that surpassed gods and monsters alike. Zeus's wife Hera, consumed by jealousy, tormented him from infancy—sending serpents to his cradle, which the baby Hercules strangled with his bare hands. This was merely the beginning of Hera's persecution, a divine hatred that would shape the hero's entire life.</p>
                        <p>Hercules grew to be the greatest warrior Greece had ever known, marrying and fathering children. But Hera struck again, driving him into a madness so complete he murdered his own wife and sons. When sanity returned and he realized what he'd done, Hercules sought the Oracle at Delphi, desperate for redemption. The Oracle sent him to serve King Eurystheus—Hera's puppet—who assigned him twelve "impossible" labors designed to kill him.</p>
                        <p>But Hercules accomplished them all: he strangled the Nemean Lion whose hide no weapon could pierce; slew the nine-headed Hydra; captured the Golden Hind of Artemis; cleaned the Augean stables in a day; drove away the Stymphalian Birds; captured the Cretan Bull; stole the man-eating Mares of Diomedes; obtained the belt of Hippolyta; captured the cattle of Geryon; stole the apples of the Hesperides; and dragged Cerberus from the underworld itself. Each labor was a legend; together they were his path to immortality. When he died, consumed by poisoned blood, Zeus brought him to Olympus where even Hera accepted him, and Hercules married her daughter Hebe, goddess of youth. The hero who lost everything gained everything—proof that no trial, no tragedy, no hatred is stronger than courage and perseverance.</p>

                        <p>Perseus's story began with a prophecy: King Acrisius of Argos learned he would be killed by his daughter's son. In fear, he imprisoned Danaë in a bronze chamber. But Zeus desired her, transforming into golden rain to reach her, and Perseus was conceived. Horrified, Acrisius locked mother and infant in a chest and cast them into the sea, leaving their fate to the gods.</p>
                        <p>The chest washed ashore on the island of Seriphos, where fisherman Dictys rescued them. Perseus grew strong and bold, catching the eye of King Polydectes, who desired Danaë. To remove Perseus, the king demanded an impossible gift: the head of Medusa, the Gorgon whose gaze turned men to stone. Perseus accepted, and the gods, moved by his bravery, armed him—Athena gave him a polished shield, Hades a helmet of invisibility, Hermes winged sandals, and Hephaestus an unbreakable sickle.</p>
                        <p>Finding the Gorgons, Perseus approached Medusa while she slept, using Athena's shield as a mirror to avoid her deadly gaze. With one swift stroke, he severed her head, and from her blood sprang Pegasus, the winged horse. Returning home, Perseus found his mother being forced to marry Polydectes. He unveiled Medusa's head at the wedding feast, turning the king and his followers to stone. Perseus then fulfilled the prophecy, accidentally killing his grandfather with a discus at athletic games. He founded Mycenae and became ancestor to the greatest hero of all: Hercules. The gods placed him among the stars, an eternal reminder that with divine favor and courage, even a mortal can slay monsters.</p>
