                        <h3>The Illuminati</h3>
                        <p>The Bavarian Illuminati was a real Enlightenment-era secret society founded in 1776 by Adam Weishaupt, disbanded by 1785. Modern conspiracy theories claim the group survived and secretly controls world events, governments, and the entertainment industry. Theorists point to supposed symbols in currency, architecture, and media as evidence. However, historians confirm the original organization dissolved centuries ago, and no credible evidence supports claims of ongoing Illuminati control.</p>

                        <h3>JFK Assassination Conspiracy</h3>
                        <p>While Lee Harvey Oswald was officially identified as President Kennedy's assassin, numerous alternative theories emerged. Some suggest involvement by the CIA, Mafia, Soviet Union, or a "second shooter" from the grassy knoll. The Warren Commission concluded Oswald acted alone, but skepticism persists due to witness testimonies, ballistic analysis debates, and Oswald's own murder by Jack Ruby. Despite extensive investigations, no definitive evidence has emerged to prove conspiracy beyond reasonable doubt.</p>

                        <h3>Moon Landing Hoax</h3>
                        <p>This theory claims NASA faked the Apollo 11 moon landing to win the Space Race against the Soviet Union. Proponents cite "evidence" like flag movement in vacuum, missing stars in photos, and suspicious lighting. However, these have been thoroughly debunked by scientists, astronauts, and photographic experts. The Soviet Union, America's competitor, tracked the mission and acknowledged its success. Thousands of NASA employees, astronauts, and independent observers confirm the landings were genuine.</p>

                        <h3>Area 51 & Roswell UFO</h3>
                        <p>In 1947, a weather balloon crashed near Roswell, New Mexico, sparking claims of an alien spacecraft recovery. Area 51, a classified Air Force facility in Nevada, allegedly houses alien technology and bodies. The secrecy surrounding Area 51 fuels speculation, though the government acknowledges it as a testing site for experimental aircraft. Declassified documents show the "UFO" was actually a Project Mogul surveillance balloon. No verified alien evidence has emerged despite numerous investigations.</p>

                        <h3>New World Order</h3>
                        <p>This theory proposes that a secretive power elite is working to establish an authoritarian world government. Supposed evidence includes globalization, international organizations like the UN, and economic policies. Proponents believe wealthy families, secret societies, and politicians collaborate toward this goal. While legitimate concerns exist about concentrated power and global inequality, no evidence supports a coordinated conspiracy to create a singular world government.</p>

                        <h3>Flat Earth Theory</h3>
                        <p>Despite overwhelming scientific evidence proving Earth is spherical, modern flat Earth believers claim the planet is a flat disc with Antarctica forming an ice wall boundary. They assert that space agencies, governments, and scientists perpetuate a "globe lie." This theory contradicts centuries of evidence including satellite imagery, physics, circumnavigation, and observations visible to anyone. The spherical Earth has been scientifically proven since ancient Greek times and is fundamental to modern navigation, aviation, and space exploration.</p>

                        <h3>Chemtrails</h3>
                        <p>This theory claims that aircraft contrails (condensation trails) are actually "chemtrails" - chemicals deliberately sprayed for sinister purposes including population control, weather modification, or biological warfare. Scientists explain that contrails are simply water vapor from jet exhaust that freezes in cold upper atmosphere. Atmospheric scientists, meteorologists, and aviation experts have repeatedly debunked chemtrail claims, but the theory persists in some communities.</p>

                        <h3>9/11 Inside Job Theories</h3>
                        <p>Various theories suggest the September 11 attacks were orchestrated or allowed by the U.S. government as a "false flag" operation. Claims include controlled demolition of the towers, missile hitting the Pentagon, and foreknowledge by officials. Extensive investigations by engineers, architects, and independent researchers have debunked these claims. The 9/11 Commission Report, scientific studies, and eyewitness accounts confirm the attacks were carried out by al-Qaeda terrorists using hijacked planes.</p>

                        <h3>Planet X (Nibiru)</h3>
                        <p>This theory claims a massive planet or brown dwarf called Nibiru will collide with Earth, causing catastrophic destruction. Various dates have been predicted and passed without incident. The theory originated from interpretations of Sumerian texts and was popularized online. Astronomers explain that such a planet would be visible years before impact and would disrupt planetary orbits. No evidence of Nibiru exists, and predictions repeatedly fail to materialize.</p>

                        <h3>Reptilian Elite</h3>
                        <p>Popularized by David Icke, this theory claims shape-shifting reptilian aliens control humanity by occupying positions of power. Supposedly, royal families, politicians, and celebrities are reptilians in disguise. Proponents cite ancient texts, mythology, and alleged witness testimonies. This theory lacks any physical evidence and contradicts biology, genetics, and anthropology. It's considered one of the more outlandish conspiracy theories with no scientific backing.</p>

                    <div id="deepstate" class="conspiracy-card">
                        <div class="conspiracy-date">2010s</div>
                        <h3>Deep State</h3>
                        <p>This theory proposes that an entrenched network of bureaucrats, intelligence operatives, and military personnel secretly controls government policy regardless of elected officials. While institutional inertia and career civil servants exist in all governments, the conspiracy version suggests coordinated sabotage of democratic processes. Political scientists acknowledge bureaucratic influence but find no evidence of a unified shadow government. The term has been politicized and used to dismiss legitimate government functions.</p>

                        <h3>5G Surveillance & Health</h3>
                        <p>Theories surrounding 5G technology claim it causes health problems, enables mass surveillance, or even caused COVID-19. Some believe 5G towers spread viruses or that the technology allows mind control. Scientific studies by health organizations worldwide, including WHO, found no evidence that 5G causes adverse health effects at regulated levels. The COVID-19 connection has been thoroughly debunked - viruses cannot travel via radio waves, and the pandemic affected areas without 5G coverage.</p>
