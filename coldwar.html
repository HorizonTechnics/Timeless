                    <h2>A World Divided</h2>
                    <p>The Cold War was a decades-long ideological, political, and military rivalry between the United States (capitalism and democracy) and the Soviet Union (communism and authoritarianism). Though the superpowers never directly fought, they engaged in proxy wars, espionage, propaganda, arms races, and competition for global influence. The nuclear arms race brought humanity closest to self-destruction. The Cold War shaped modern geopolitics, ended with the Soviet Union's collapse, and left legacies affecting current international relations.</p>

                    </div>

                    <h3>Origins of the Cold War</h3>
                    <p>WWII's Grand Alliance (US, Britain, USSR) united against Nazi Germany but harbored deep ideological differences. As war ended, disputes emerged over Europe's future. The Soviet Union, having lost 27 million people, wanted security through control of Eastern Europe. The West feared Soviet expansion and communist ideology.</p>
                    <p><strong>Iron Curtain (1946):</strong> Winston Churchill warned that "an iron curtain has descended across the continent," dividing communist East from capitalist West. Soviet-backed communist governments took power in Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Bulgaria, and East Germany, creating a Soviet sphere of influence.</p>
                    <p><strong>Containment Policy:</strong> US diplomat George Kennan proposed containing Soviet expansion. The Truman Doctrine (1947) pledged to support nations resisting communism. The Marshall Plan (1948) provided $13 billion to rebuild Western Europe, preventing communist takeovers through economic prosperity.</p>

                    <h3>Early Cold War Crises</h3>
                    <p><strong>Berlin Blockade (1948-1949):</strong> Soviets blocked Western access to West Berlin, isolated within East Germany. The US and Britain responded with the Berlin Airlift, flying in supplies for 11 months. The blockade failed, but Germany was divided into East (communist) and West (capitalist).</p>
                    <p><strong>NATO and Warsaw Pact:</strong> Western nations formed NATO (1949) for collective defense: "an attack on one is an attack on all." The Soviet Union responded with the Warsaw Pact (1955), creating opposing military alliances that structured Cold War divisions.</p>

                    <h3>The Nuclear Arms Race</h3>
                    <p>America's atomic monopoly ended when the Soviet Union tested its first bomb (1949). Both sides developed thermonuclear (hydrogen) bombs thousands of times more powerful. ICBMs (Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles) could deliver nuclear warheads across continents in minutes.</p>
                    <p>The doctrine of Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD) held that both sides possessed enough nuclear weapons to destroy the other, making nuclear war suicidal for both. This paradoxically prevented direct war but created constant fear of accidental or intentional nuclear holocaust. At its peak, global arsenals contained 70,000 nuclear warheads - enough to destroy civilization many times over.</p>

                    <h3>Korean War (1950-1953)</h3>
                    <p>Communist North Korea invaded South Korea (June 1950). The UN, led by the US, intervened. China entered on North Korea's side. The war stalemated near the 38th parallel where it began. An armistice (1953) ended fighting but no peace treaty was signed - technically, the war never ended. Korea remained divided, demonstrating Cold War proxy war patterns.</p>

                    </div>

                    <h3>The Space Race</h3>
                    <p>Cold War competition extended to space, demonstrating technological superiority and ICBMs' development. <strong>Sputnik (1957):</strong> Soviet launch of the first artificial satellite shocked America, sparking fears of technological inferiority. <strong>Yuri Gagarin (1961):</strong> First human in space was Soviet. America responded by landing on the Moon (1969), winning the "space race." Space competition accelerated technological development in satellites, computers, and telecommunications.</p>

                    <h3>Cuban Missile Crisis (1962)</h3>
                    <p>The Cold War's most dangerous moment. The Soviet Union placed nuclear missiles in Cuba, 90 miles from Florida. President Kennedy demanded their removal, blockading Cuba. For 13 days, nuclear war seemed imminent. Soviet Premier Khrushchev agreed to remove missiles in exchange for American removal of missiles from Turkey and a pledge not to invade Cuba. This crisis established the "Washington-Moscow hotline" for emergency communication and demonstrated nuclear war's real danger.</p>

                    <h3>Vietnam War (1955-1975)</h3>
                    <p>America supported South Vietnam against communist North Vietnam and Viet Cong guerrillas. US involvement escalated from advisors (1950s) to 500,000+ troops (1968). Despite superior firepower, America couldn't defeat determined guerrillas. The war divided American society, sparking massive protests. America withdrew (1973); Saigon fell (1975). The war killed 3+ million Vietnamese and 58,000 Americans, demonstrating limits of superpower military might and turning American public opinion against Cold War interventions.</p>

                    <h3>Détente (1970s)</h3>
                    <p>Tensions eased somewhat in the 1970s. The Strategic Arms Limitation Treaties (SALT I and II) limited nuclear weapons. Nixon visited China (1972), exploiting Sino-Soviet split. The Helsinki Accords (1975) improved East-West relations and established human rights standards. However, détente collapsed with Soviet invasion of Afghanistan (1979), which America opposed by arming Afghan mujahideen.</p>

                    <h3>Reagan and the Second Cold War (1980s)</h3>
                    <p>President Reagan called the Soviet Union an "evil empire," launching a military buildup including the Strategic Defense Initiative ("Star Wars"). This renewed arms race strained Soviet economy. Solidarity movement in Poland challenged communist rule. The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan became their "Vietnam," draining resources and morale.</p>

                    <h3>Gorbachev and Reform</h3>
                    <p>Mikhail Gorbachev became Soviet leader (1985), recognizing the system's failures. He introduced <strong>glasnost</strong> (openness) allowing free speech and <strong>perestroika</strong> (restructuring) reforming the economy. However, reforms unleashed forces Gorbachev couldn't control. Eastern European nations demanded freedom.</p>

                    <h3>Fall of the Berlin Wall (1989)</h3>
                    <p>The Berlin Wall, built in 1961 to stop East Germans fleeing to the West, symbolized Cold War division. On November 9, 1989, amid mass protests, East Germany opened the border. Germans from both sides celebrated, tearing down the wall. This moment symbolized communism's collapse in Eastern Europe. Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Romania, and Bulgaria all overthrew communist governments. Germany reunified (1990).</p>

                    <h3>Collapse of the Soviet Union (1991)</h3>
                    <p>Communist hardliners attempted a coup against Gorbachev (August 1991) but failed. Boris Yeltsin, Russia's president, emerged as a hero. Soviet republics declared independence. On December 26, 1991, the Soviet Union officially dissolved. The Cold War ended - not with nuclear holocaust but with communism's peaceful implosion. The United States emerged as the world's sole superpower.</p>

                    <h3>Proxy Wars and Conflicts</h3>
                    <p>The Cold War spawned numerous conflicts worldwide. Both superpowers supported opposing sides in civil wars and revolutions: Angola, Mozambique, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Cambodia, Afghanistan, and many others. These proxy wars devastated countries caught between superpower rivalry, killing millions and leaving lasting instability.</p>

                    <h3>Espionage and Intelligence</h3>
                    <p>The CIA and KGB waged shadow wars of espionage, coups, and assassinations. Famous spies like Kim Philby (British double agent) and Aldrich Ames (CIA traitor) passed secrets between sides. Both superpowers overthrew governments, installed dictators, and manipulated elections globally. This covert warfare shaped politics in Latin America, Africa, and Asia.</p>

                    <h3>Culture and Ideology</h3>
                    <p>The Cold War was an ideological struggle. America promoted capitalism, individual freedom, and democracy. The Soviet Union championed communism, collective ownership, and central planning. Both sides used propaganda, depicting the other as evil. Cultural exchanges, sports competitions (Olympics), and even chess matches became ideological battlegrounds. The "American Dream" and Soviet "workers' paradise" competed for hearts and minds globally.</p>

                    <h3>Decolonization and the Third World</h3>
                    <p>As European empires collapsed post-WWII, newly independent nations became Cold War battlegrounds. The Non-Aligned Movement (led by India, Egypt, Yugoslavia) tried remaining neutral but faced pressure to choose sides. Both superpowers provided aid, weapons, and support to gain allies. This competition shaped developing world politics, often supporting dictators and fueling conflicts.</p>

                    <h3>Technology and Science</h3>
                    <p>Cold War competition accelerated technological development. Nuclear energy, space technology, computers, Internet (originally ARPANET), GPS, and countless innovations emerged from military research. The space race spun off technologies now ubiquitous. However, resources devoted to weapons represented enormous opportunity costs - money spent on missiles wasn't spent on schools, hospitals, or infrastructure.</p>

                    <h2>Legacy of the Cold War</h2>
                    <p>The Cold War shaped modern geopolitics. NATO expanded eastward post-Cold War, creating tensions with Russia continuing today. Nuclear weapons remain, with proliferation concerns (North Korea, Iran). Former Soviet states struggle with democracy and economic development. The US "unipolar moment" after Cold War victory proved temporary as China rose and Russia reasserted itself.</p>
                    <p>The Cold War demonstrated that nuclear weapons make great power war unthinkable - a "nuclear taboo" that has held since 1945. It showed ideological competition's power and limits. It accelerated decolonization and globalization. Its end didn't bring "the end of history" but new challenges: terrorism, climate change, cyber warfare, and multipolar competition. Understanding the Cold War helps navigate contemporary international tensions and appreciate how close humanity came to nuclear catastrophe.</p>
