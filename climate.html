                    <h2>Our Planet in Crisis</h2>
                    <p>Climate change represents the defining challenge of our era. Human activities, primarily burning fossil fuels, have increased atmospheric CO2 from 280 parts per million (pre-industrial) to over 420 ppm today - the highest in 3 million years. Global temperatures have risen 1.1°C since 1880, triggering cascading effects: melting ice caps, rising seas, extreme weather, ecosystem collapse, and threats to food and water security. The science is unequivocal - climate change is real, human-caused, and demands urgent action.</p>

                    <div class="image-card">
                        <img src="images/melting.jpg" alt="Melting glacier">
                        <div class="image-caption">Melting glaciers - visible evidence of warming climate</div>
                    </div>

                    <h3>The Science of Climate Change</h3>
                    <p><strong>The Greenhouse Effect:</strong> Certain gases (CO2, methane, nitrous oxide) trap heat in Earth's atmosphere like a greenhouse. This natural effect makes Earth habitable, but human emissions have intensified it dramatically. We're adding 40+ billion tons of CO2 annually through fossil fuel combustion, deforestation, and industrial processes.</p>

                    <div class="image-card">
                        <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1611273426858-450d8e3c9fce?w=800&h=500&fit=crop" alt="Industrial emissions">
                        <div class="image-caption">Industrial emissions - the primary driver of climate change</div>
                    </div>

                    <p><strong>Evidence:</strong> Temperature records show consistent warming across land, oceans, and atmosphere. Arctic sea ice has declined 13% per decade since 1979. Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets lose 500+ billion tons of ice yearly. Ocean heat content increases steadily. Spring arrives earlier, growing seasons lengthen, and species migrate poleward. The evidence is overwhelming and unambiguous.</p>

                    <h3>Impacts We're Experiencing Now</h3>
                    <div class="image-card">
                        <img src="images/extreme.jpg" alt="Extreme weather">
                        <div class="image-caption">Extreme weather events increasing in frequency and intensity</div>
                    </div>

                    <p><strong>Extreme Weather:</strong> Heatwaves break records regularly. The European heatwave of 2023 killed thousands. Droughts intensify - the American West faces its worst megadrought in 1,200 years. Wildfires grow larger and more destructive; California, Australia, and the Amazon experience unprecedented burning. Hurricanes intensify faster and dump more rain. Flooding devastates communities from Pakistan to Germany.</p>

                    <p><strong>Melting Ice and Rising Seas:</strong> Sea levels have risen 21-24cm since 1880 and accelerate yearly. Ice loss from Greenland and Antarctica contribute most. Thermal expansion as oceans warm adds more. Coastal cities face increased flooding; Miami, Jakarta, and Shanghai spend billions on defenses. Small island nations like Tuvalu and Maldives face existential threats.</p>

                    <p><strong>Ecosystem Disruption:</strong> Coral reefs bleach and die as oceans warm and acidify - we've lost 50% of coral reefs since 1950. Species cannot adapt fast enough; extinction rates are 1,000 times natural background rates. Phenology (seasonal timing) shifts disrupt food webs. Arctic ecosystems transform as permafrost thaws, releasing methane and CO2 in dangerous feedback loops.</p>

                    <h3>Human Impacts</h3>
                    <div class="image-card">
                        <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1625246333195-78d9c38ad449?w=800&h=500&fit=crop" alt="Drought impact">
                        <div class="image-caption">Drought and agricultural impacts threaten food security</div>
                    </div>

                    <p><strong>Food Security:</strong> Crop yields decline as temperatures exceed optimal ranges. Wheat, rice, and maize production face threats. Droughts reduce harvests while floods destroy crops. Fisheries collapse as ocean ecosystems change. Food prices spike, threatening the poorest nations most. By 2050, an additional 100+ million people could face hunger from climate impacts.</p>

                    <p><strong>Water Scarcity:</strong> Glaciers that provide water to 2 billion people are melting. Groundwater depletes faster than replenishment. Droughts intensify. Water conflicts emerge in Middle East, Africa, and South Asia. By 2025, two-thirds of humanity may face water stress.</p>

                    <p><strong>Health:</strong> Heat stress kills directly - heatwaves cause thousands of deaths annually. Air pollution from fossil fuels causes 7+ million deaths yearly. Disease vectors expand - malaria, dengue, and Zika spread to new areas. Food and water insecurity trigger malnutrition. Mental health impacts grow as communities face displacement and loss.</p>

                    <p><strong>Climate Migration:</strong> The World Bank estimates 200+ million climate migrants by 2050. Small island nations evacuate. Coastal flooding displaces millions. Droughts drive rural-to-urban migration. Climate change becomes a threat multiplier for conflict, as seen in Syria where drought contributed to civil war.</p>

                    <h3>Tipping Points</h3>
                    <div class="image-card">
                        <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1584267385494-9fdd9a71ad75?w=800&h=500&fit=crop" alt="Ice sheet collapse">
                        <div class="image-caption">Ice sheet collapse represents a dangerous tipping point</div>
                    </div>

                    <p>Climate scientists warn of tipping points - thresholds beyond which changes become irreversible and self-reinforcing:</p>
                    <p><strong>Amazon Rainforest Dieback:</strong> Deforestation and warming could flip the Amazon from carbon sink to carbon source.</p>
                    <p><strong>Arctic Ice Loss:</strong> Ice reflects sunlight; dark ocean absorbs heat, accelerating warming.</p>
                    <p><strong>Permafrost Thaw:</strong> Frozen soil holds twice the carbon in the atmosphere. Thawing releases methane and CO2.</p>
                    <p><strong>Ice Sheet Collapse:</strong> West Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets could reach instability, committing us to meters of sea-level rise.</p>
                    <p><strong>Atlantic Circulation Weakening:</strong> The Gulf Stream system slows, disrupting weather patterns globally.</p>

                    <h3>The Path Forward: Mitigation</h3>
                    <div class="image-card">
                        <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1509391366360-2e959784a276?w=800&h=500&fit=crop" alt="Solar panels">
                        <div class="image-caption">Renewable energy transition is key to climate solutions</div>
                    </div>

                    <p><strong>The Paris Agreement (2015):</strong> 195 nations agreed to limit warming to "well below" 2°C, preferably 1.5°C. Countries submitted Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) outlining emission reduction plans. However, current commitments lead to 2.4-2.7°C warming - insufficient to avoid severe impacts.</p>

                    <p><strong>Renewable Energy Transition:</strong> Solar and wind power costs have plummeted 90% since 2010, becoming cheapest electricity in history. Battery storage costs fell 97% since 1991. Renewables now provide 30% of global electricity. We need to accelerate: phase out coal by 2030, transition transportation to electric, electrify heating, and expand renewable capacity dramatically.</p>

                    <p><strong>Energy Efficiency:</strong> Using less energy is often cheaper than producing clean energy. Better insulation, LED lighting, efficient appliances, and smart systems can cut energy use 40%. Cities redesigned for public transit, cycling, and walking reduce emissions while improving quality of life.</p>

                    <p><strong>Carbon Pricing:</strong> Putting a price on carbon emissions incentivizes reduction. Carbon taxes and cap-and-trade systems are implemented in EU, California, and elsewhere. Revenue can fund clean energy or be returned as dividends.</p>

                    <h3>Nature-Based Solutions</h3>
                    <p><strong>Reforestation and Afforestation:</strong> Trees absorb CO2. Protecting existing forests and planting billions more can sequester significant carbon. The Trillion Tree Campaign aims to restore degraded lands globally.</p>

                    <p><strong>Regenerative Agriculture:</strong> Practices like cover cropping, no-till farming, and rotational grazing rebuild soil carbon while improving yields and resilience. Soil holds more carbon than atmosphere and vegetation combined.</p>

                    <p><strong>Ocean and Coastal Ecosystems:</strong> Mangroves, seagrass beds, and salt marshes ("blue carbon") sequester carbon rapidly. Protecting and restoring these ecosystems benefits both climate and biodiversity.</p>

                    <h3>Adaptation and Resilience</h3>
                    <div class="image-card">
                        <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1551522435-a13afa10f103?w=800&h=500&fit=crop" alt="Climate resilient infrastructure">
                        <div class="image-caption">Building climate-resilient infrastructure protects communities</div>
                    </div>

                    <p>Even with aggressive mitigation, we must adapt to changes already locked in:</p>
                    <p><strong>Infrastructure:</strong> Build seawalls, elevate buildings, design for extreme heat, strengthen grids against storms, create flood management systems.</p>
                    <p><strong>Agriculture:</strong> Develop drought and heat-resistant crops, diversify production, improve irrigation efficiency, shift planting zones.</p>
                    <p><strong>Water Management:</strong> Invest in desalination, water recycling, efficient irrigation, watershed protection, reservoir expansion.</p>
                    <p><strong>Early Warning Systems:</strong> Improve weather forecasting, disaster preparedness, emergency response, and community resilience.</p>

                    <h3>Individual Action</h3>
                    <p>While systemic change is crucial, individual actions matter:</p>
                    <p>• <strong>Reduce energy use:</strong> Insulate homes, use efficient appliances, choose renewables</p>
                    <p>• <strong>Transportation:</strong> Walk, bike, use public transit, drive electric</p>
                    <p>• <strong>Diet:</strong> Eat less meat, reduce food waste, choose local/seasonal foods</p>
                    <p>• <strong>Consumption:</strong> Buy less, choose quality/durability, repair rather than replace</p>
                    <p>• <strong>Political action:</strong> Vote for climate leaders, support policies, join movements</p>
                    <p>• <strong>Spread awareness:</strong> Educate others, have conversations, amplify climate voices</p>

                    <h2>Hope and Action</h2>
                    <p>Climate change is daunting, but solutions exist and progress is happening. Renewable energy grows exponentially. Electric vehicles outsell gas cars in many markets. Youth movements demand action. Countries commit to net-zero emissions. Technology advances rapidly. Nature proves resilient when given the chance.</p>

                    <p>The next decade is critical. Decisions made now determine humanity's future. We can limit warming to manageable levels, but only with unprecedented cooperation and urgency. The climate crisis demands transformation of energy, transportation, agriculture, industry, and society. This challenge is also an opportunity - to build a cleaner, fairer, more sustainable world. The question isn't whether we can act, but whether we will. Our children and grandchildren will judge our response. The time for action is now.</p>
