                    </div>

                    <p><strong>Yuri Gagarin (1961):</strong> Soviet cosmonaut Gagarin became the first human in space aboard Vostok 1, orbiting Earth once in 108 minutes. His famous words "Poyekhali!" ("Let's go!") marked humanity's entry into space. America responded by sending Alan Shepard to space weeks later, beginning intense superpower competition.</p>

                    <p><strong>Apollo 11 (1969):</strong> Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin became the first humans to walk on the Moon while Michael Collins orbited above. Armstrong's words - "That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind" - remain iconic. Six Apollo missions successfully landed on the Moon between 1969-1972, returning 382kg of lunar samples and demonstrating extraordinary technological achievement.</p>

                    <h3>Space Stations and International Cooperation</h3>

                    </div>

                    <p><strong>Salyut and Skylab (1970s):</strong> The Soviet Union launched Salyut, the first space station series, demonstrating humans could live in space for extended periods. America's Skylab hosted three crews studying zero-gravity effects and Earth observation. These early stations proved long-duration spaceflight's feasibility.</p>

                    <p><strong>Mir (1986-2001):</strong> This Soviet/Russian station operated for 15 years, hosting international crews and conducting extensive scientific research. Mir demonstrated that humans could continuously inhabit space, with some cosmonauts spending over a year aboard. The station survived numerous technical challenges and served as a testbed for ISS collaboration.</p>

                    <p><strong>International Space Station (1998-present):</strong> The ISS represents the largest international cooperation in space history. Built by five space agencies (NASA, Roscosmos, ESA, JAXA, CSA), it has hosted over 270 astronauts from 20 countries. Orbiting 400km above Earth, the ISS serves as a laboratory for microgravity research, Earth observation, and technology testing. Continuous human presence in space since November 2000 demonstrates our commitment to becoming a spacefaring civilization.</p>

                        <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1614314107768-6018061b5b72?w=800&h=500&fit=crop" alt="Mars surface">
                        <div class="image-caption">Mars as captured by rovers - the Red Planet up close</div>
                    </div>

                    <p><strong>Voyager Program (1977-present):</strong> Voyagers 1 and 2 explored Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, sending back stunning images and data. Voyager 1 entered interstellar space in 2012, becoming humanity's first interstellar ambassador. Both carry golden records with sounds and images of Earth for potential alien discovery. Still operational after 45+ years, they're humanity's most distant messengers.</p>

                    <p><strong>Mars Rovers:</strong> Sojourner (1997), Spirit and Opportunity (2004), Curiosity (2012), and Perseverance (2021) have explored Mars's surface, searching for signs of past life and studying Martian geology. Opportunity operated for 15 years, far exceeding its 90-day mission. Perseverance and Ingenuity (first helicopter on another world) currently explore Jezero Crater, collecting samples for eventual return to Earth.</p>

                    <p><strong>Cassini-Huygens (1997-2017):</strong> This mission revolutionized our understanding of Saturn, its rings, and moons. The Huygens probe landed on Titan, revealing methane lakes and a thick atmosphere. Cassini discovered water geysers on Enceladus, suggesting subsurface oceans that might harbor life. The mission ended with Cassini diving into Saturn's atmosphere.</p>

                    <h3>Satellites: Eyes on Earth and Beyond</h3>
                    <p><strong>Communications Satellites:</strong> Over 8,000 satellites currently orbit Earth, enabling global communications, GPS navigation, weather forecasting, and internet connectivity. Starlink alone plans 42,000 satellites for global internet coverage. These satellites transform daily life, though space debris concerns grow.</p>

                    <p><strong>Earth Observation:</strong> Satellites monitor climate change, deforestation, ocean temperatures, ice cap melting, and natural disasters. Landsat series (1972-present) provides the longest continuous Earth observation record. Modern satellites track environmental changes in real-time, informing climate science and disaster response.</p>

                    <p><strong>Space Telescopes:</strong> Hubble (1990-present) revolutionized astronomy with breathtaking images and discoveries about universe expansion, black holes, and galaxy formation. The James Webb Space Telescope (2021-present) peers even deeper into space and time, studying the universe's first galaxies and searching for biosignatures on exoplanets.</p>

                    <h3>Exoplanet Discovery</h3>
                    <div class="image-card">
                        <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1462331940025-496dfbfc7564?w=800&h=500&fit=crop" alt="Exoplanet illustration">
                        <div class="image-caption">Artist's concept of an exoplanet - thousands of worlds beyond our solar system</div>
                    </div>

                    <p>The Kepler Space Telescope (2009-2018) discovered 2,600+ confirmed exoplanets, revealing that planets are common throughout the galaxy. TESS (Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite) continues the search, finding potentially habitable worlds. We now know of over 5,000 exoplanets, with billions estimated in our galaxy. Some orbit in "habitable zones" where liquid water could exist - prime targets in the search for alien life.</p>

                    <h3>Commercial Space Era</h3>
                    <p><strong>SpaceX:</strong> Founded by Elon Musk in 2002, SpaceX revolutionized spaceflight with reusable rockets, dramatically reducing costs. Falcon 9 first stages routinely land and relaunch. Dragon spacecraft carries cargo and astronauts to the ISS. Starship, under development, aims to enable Mars colonization with fully reusable super-heavy lift capability.</p>

                    <p><strong>Blue Origin:</strong> Jeff Bezos's company focuses on reusable rockets and space tourism. New Shepard offers suborbital flights, while New Glenn will compete with SpaceX for orbital missions. Blue Moon aims to return humans to the lunar surface.</p>

                    <p><strong>Space Tourism:</strong> Virgin Galactic, Blue Origin, and SpaceX now offer space tourism, making space accessible to private citizens (albeit wealthy ones). The space tourism industry could fund further exploration and make space more familiar to the public.</p>

                    <h3>Return to the Moon: Artemis Program</h3>
                    <p>NASA's Artemis program aims to return humans to the Moon by 2025, including the first woman and person of color.

                        <img src="images/mars.jpg" alt="Mars mission concept">
                        <div class="image-caption">Future Mars mission concept - humanity's next destination</div>
                    </div>

                    <p>Multiple space agencies and companies plan crewed Mars missions for the 2030s-2040s. Challenges include 6-9 month travel time, radiation exposure, life support systems, and psychological factors. SpaceX's Starship and NASA's plans both target Mars, with different approaches. Establishing self-sustaining Mars colonies would make humanity a multi-planetary species, insurance against existential threats on Earth.</p>

                    <h3>The Search for Life</h3>
                    <p>Astrobiology seeks life beyond Earth. Missions target promising locations: Mars (past microbial life), Europa and Enceladus (subsurface oceans), Titan (organic chemistry). The James Webb telescope searches for biosignatures in exoplanet atmospheres. SETI continues listening for alien signals. While no definitive evidence exists yet, the discovery of extremophiles on Earth and organic molecules in space suggest life might be common. Finding even microbial life elsewhere would revolutionize our understanding of biology and our place in the cosmos.</p>

                    <h3>Space Science and Technology</h3>
                    <p>Space exploration drives technological innovation: satellite communications, GPS, weather forecasting, medical imaging, water purification, solar panels, and countless other technologies originated from space programs. Space research advances materials science, robotics, artificial intelligence, and medicine. The "space spin-off" effect generates far more economic value than space program costs.</p>

                    <h3>Challenges and Future</h3>
                    <p>Space exploration faces challenges: high costs, technical complexity, human health risks, space debris, and competing priorities on Earth. However, benefits include scientific discovery, technological advancement, international cooperation, resource acquisition, and ensuring humanity's long-term survival. As costs decrease and capabilities increase, space becomes more accessible.</p>

                    <p>Future missions planned include Europa Clipper (searching for life), asteroid mining ventures, space-based solar power, and eventually interstellar probes. Private companies, international cooperation, and human imagination drive continued expansion into space.</p>

                    <h2>Why Explore Space?</h2>
                    <p>Space exploration inspires humanity, advances knowledge, drives technology, unites nations, and expands human potential. It represents our curiosity, ambition, and determination to understand our universe. As Carl Sagan said, we are "star-stuff contemplating stars" - space exploration is ultimately about understanding ourselves and our cosmic origins. The final frontier beckons, and humanity answers the call.</p>
