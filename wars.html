                    <h2>The War to End All Wars</h2>
                    <p>The 20th century's first half witnessed two devastating global conflicts that killed over 100 million people, redrew world maps, ended empires, and introduced weapons of mass destruction. These wars transformed warfare, politics, society, and technology, leaving legacies that still shape our world. Understanding these conflicts is essential to comprehending modern history.</p>

                        <div class="image-caption">The brutal reality of trench warfare in World War I</div>
                    </div>

                    <h3>World War I (1914-1918)</h3>
                    <p><strong>Causes:</strong> Complex factors created a powder keg in Europe. <strong>Nationalism</strong> fueled competition and ethnic tensions. <strong>Imperialism</strong> created colonial rivalries. <strong>Militarism</strong> led to arms races, particularly Anglo-German naval competition. <strong>Alliance systems</strong> divided Europe: Triple Alliance (Germany, Austria-Hungary, Italy) vs. Triple Entente (Britain, France, Russia). The <strong>Balkan Wars</strong> created instability in southeastern Europe, the "powder keg of Europe."</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>The Spark:</strong> On June 28, 1914, Gavrilo Princip, a Serbian nationalist, assassinated Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria-Hungary in Sarajevo. Austria-Hungary blamed Serbia. Alliance obligations triggered declarations: Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia (July 28), Russia mobilized to support Serbia, Germany declared war on Russia (August 1) and France (August 3), Germany invaded Belgium, Britain declared war on Germany (August 4). Within weeks, Europe was at war.</p>

                    <h3>The Western Front</h3>
                    <p>Germany's Schlieffen Plan attempted to quickly defeat France before fighting Russia. German armies invaded Belgium and advanced toward Paris but were stopped at the Battle of the Marne (September 1914). Both sides dug trenches from the Swiss border to the English Channel, beginning four years of brutal stalemate.</p>
                    <p>Trench warfare was horrific. Soldiers lived in muddy trenches, facing artillery bombardments, machine gun fire, and gas attacks. "Going over the top" meant charging across "no man's land" into enemy fire. Battles like Verdun (1916, 700,000 casualties) and the Somme (1916, 1+ million casualties) gained minimal ground at terrible cost. New weapons - poison gas, tanks, flamethrowers, aircraft - added to the carnage.</p>

                    <h3>Other Fronts and Global War</h3>
                    <p><strong>Eastern Front:</strong> More mobile than the West, with huge territorial gains and losses. Germany defeated Russia at Tannenberg (1914). The Russian Revolution (1917) ended Russian participation. The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (March 1918) gave Germany territory but freed Russian resources.</p>
                    <p><strong>Italian Front:</strong> Italy joined the Allies (1915) hoping to gain territory. Eleven battles along the Isonzo River produced stalemate. Caporetto (1917) nearly knocked Italy out.</p>
                    <p><strong>Middle East:</strong> Ottoman Empire joined Central Powers. Britain promised Arabs independence for revolting against Ottomans (Lawrence of Arabia). The Balfour Declaration (1917) promised Jews a homeland in Palestine, creating future conflicts. Gallipoli campaign (1915-1916) failed to knock out Ottomans.</p>
                    <p><strong>Colonial Theaters:</strong> Fighting occurred in Africa, Asia, and Pacific as European powers' colonies joined.</p>

                    <h3>United States Enters the War</h3>
                    <p>America initially remained neutral. However, German submarine warfare, particularly the Lusitania sinking (1915), turned public opinion. The Zimmermann Telegram (1917) revealed German attempts to ally with Mexico against the US. America declared war (April 1917). American troops and resources tipped the balance. By 1918, 10,000 Americans arrived daily in France.</p>

                    <h3>End of WWI</h3>
                    <p>Germany's Spring Offensive (1918) initially succeeded but exhausted German forces. Allied counter-offenses with fresh American troops broke German lines. Germany's allies collapsed: Bulgaria (September), Ottoman Empire (October), Austria-Hungary (November). Germany faced revolution at home. On November 11, 1918, an armistice ended fighting. The "war to end all wars" killed 17+ million, wounded 20+ million, and traumatized a generation.</p>

                    <h3>Treaty of Versailles (1919)</h3>
                    <p>The Paris Peace Conference redrew Europe. The Treaty of Versailles blamed Germany, imposed harsh terms: territorial losses (Alsace-Lorraine to France, Polish Corridor dividing Germany), colonies lost, military restricted to 100,000 troops, and crushing reparations (£6.6 billion). Germans felt humiliated by the "Diktat." Many historians argue Versailles's harshness created conditions for Hitler's rise and WWII.</p>
                    <p>The League of Nations was created to prevent future wars but lacked enforcement power and US membership. New nations emerged: Poland, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania. Four empires collapsed: German, Austro-Hungarian, Ottoman, and Russian.</p>

                    </div>

                    <h3>Between the Wars (1918-1939)</h3>
                    <p>The interwar period saw economic crisis, political extremism, and failed diplomacy. The Great Depression (1929) created massive unemployment and desperation. Fascism rose in Italy (Mussolini, 1922) and Germany (Hitler, 1933). Japan pursued imperial expansion in Asia. The League of Nations failed to stop Italian invasion of Ethiopia (1935), Japanese invasion of China (1937), or German remilitarization and expansion.</p>
                    <p>Western democracies pursued appeasement, hoping to avoid another war. The Munich Agreement (1938) gave Hitler the Sudetenland, but he continued expanding. On September 1, 1939, Germany invaded Poland. Britain and France declared war. World War II began.</p>

                    <h3>World War II: Europe (1939-1945)</h3>
                    <p><strong>Blitzkrieg:</strong> Germany's "lightning war" combined tanks, aircraft, and infantry for rapid conquest. Poland fell in weeks. The "Phoney War" (winter 1939-1940) saw little fighting. In spring 1940, Germany conquered Denmark, Norway, Netherlands, Belgium, and France in six weeks. Britain stood alone, surviving the Battle of Britain (1940) when the RAF defeated the Luftwaffe.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Operation Barbarossa (June 1941):</strong> Hitler invaded the Soviet Union with 3+ million troops, history's largest invasion. Initial success brought Germans to Moscow's gates, but the Red Army held. The brutal Siege of Leningrad (872 days) killed 1+ million. The Battle of Stalingrad (1942-1943) was WWII's turning point - Germany's catastrophic defeat began their long retreat.</p>

                    <p><strong>North Africa and Italy:</strong> Fighting in deserts between Rommel's Afrika Korps and British forces. Allied victory at El Alamein (1942) turned the tide. Sicily invasion (1943) led to Italian surrender, but German resistance in Italy continued until 1945.</p>

                    <p><strong>D-Day and Liberation (June 6, 1944):</strong> Allied invasion of Normandy, history's largest amphibious assault. Despite heavy casualties, Allies established beachhead. Paris liberated (August 1944). Germany's Battle of the Bulge offensive (December 1944) failed. Soviets advanced from east, Allies from west. Germany surrendered May 8, 1945 (V-E Day). Hitler committed suicide April 30.</p>

                    <h3>World War II: Pacific (1941-1945)</h3>
                    <p>Japan sought Asian empire, invading China (1937). US embargoed oil exports, threatening Japan's military. On December 7, 1941, Japan attacked Pearl Harbor, killing 2,400 Americans. America declared war. Japan rapidly conquered Southeast Asia and Pacific islands.</p>
                    <p>The tide turned at Midway (June 1942) when US Navy destroyed four Japanese carriers. Island-hopping campaigns (Guadalcanal, Iwo Jima, Okinawa) brought America closer to Japan at terrible cost. Firebombing devastated Japanese cities. On August 6 and 9, 1945, atomic bombs destroyed Hiroshima and Nagasaki, killing 200,000+. Japan surrendered August 15 (V-J Day).</p>

                    <h3>The Holocaust</h3>
                    <p>Nazi Germany systematically murdered 6 million Jews and millions of others (Romani, disabled, homosexuals, political opponents) in history's most organized genocide. Concentration camps like Auschwitz used gas chambers for industrial-scale murder. The Holocaust represents human cruelty's darkest depths. "Never again" became the rallying cry, leading to genocide conventions and war crimes tribunals.</p>

                    <h3>Technology and Tactics</h3>
                    <p>WWII saw revolutionary weapons: jets, rockets (V-2), radar, sonar, computers (Enigma codebreaking), and atomic bombs. Mechanized warfare with tanks, aircraft carriers, strategic bombing, and combined arms tactics replaced WWI's static trenches. Total war mobilized entire societies - civilians were targets and participants.</p>

                    <h3>Casualties and Destruction</h3>
                    <p>WWII killed 70-85 million people (3% of world population), including 40+ million civilians. Soviet Union lost 27 million. China 15-20 million. Germany 7 million. Poland 6 million (17% of population). Japan 3 million. Cities were destroyed. Infrastructure collapsed. Refugees numbered in millions. Europe and Asia lay in ruins.</p>

                    <h3>Post-War Settlement</h3>
                    <p>The United Nations (1945) replaced the failed League of Nations. The Nuremberg Trials (1945-1946) prosecuted Nazi war criminals, establishing principles for international justice. Germany was divided into occupation zones (eventually East and West Germany). Japan was occupied and democratized by America. Decolonization began as European empires weakened. The Cold War between US and Soviet Union would dominate the next half-century.</p>

                    <h2>Legacy of the World Wars</h2>
                    <p>These conflicts ended European global dominance, began American and Soviet superpowers, accelerated decolonization, demonstrated modern war's total devastation, created international institutions (UN, NATO, EU), advanced technology dramatically, established human rights norms and war crimes law, and left traumas affecting generations. The atomic age began, giving humanity power to destroy itself. Understanding these wars helps us appreciate peace's value and vigilance's necessity against totalitarianism and genocide.</p>

            <div class="info-section">
                <h2>What is the Doomsday Clock?</h2>
                <p>The Doomsday Clock is a symbolic timepiece established in 1947 by the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists. It represents how close humanity is to self-annihilation, with midnight symbolizing global catastrophe. The clock's time is determined by the Bulletin's Science and Security Board, which includes scientists and policy experts who assess existential threats to civilization.</p>
                
                <h3>What Midnight Represents</h3>
                <p><strong>Midnight = Global Catastrophe</strong></p>
                <p>When the clock reaches midnight, it signifies a point of no return - the moment when humanity faces existential threats from which recovery may be impossible. This includes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Nuclear war and nuclear weapons proliferation</li>
                    <li>Catastrophic climate change</li>
                    <li>Emerging disruptive technologies (AI, biotech) used irresponsibly</li>
                    <li>Breakdown of global information systems and democratic processes</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <!-- How It Works -->
            <div class="info-section">
                <h2>How the Clock is Set</h2>
                <p>The Bulletin's Science and Security Board, in consultation with the Board of Sponsors (which includes 10 Nobel laureates), evaluates global threats annually. They consider:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Nuclear Risk:</strong> Arms races, nuclear stockpiles, treaty violations, regional tensions</li>
                    <li><strong>Climate Change:</strong> Carbon emissions, temperature rise, extreme weather events, policy responses</li>
                    <li><strong>Disruptive Technologies:</strong> AI development, biological weapons, cyber warfare capabilities</li>
                    <li><strong>Information Ecosystem:</strong> Disinformation, undermining of science, erosion of democratic norms</li>

            <div class="info-section">
            <h2>Consequences of Moving Forward or Backward</h2>
            
            <h3>Moving Forward (Closer to Midnight) 🔴</h3>
            <p><strong>What it means:</strong> Humanity faces increased existential risk from multiple sources simultaneously.</p>
            <p><strong>Consequences:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Heightened global tensions and reduced diplomatic cooperation</li>
                <li>Increased likelihood of nuclear accidents or intentional use</li>
                <li>Accelerating climate tipping points becoming irreversible</li>
                <li>Greater risk from emerging technologies deployed without adequate safeguards</li>
                <li>Erosion of international institutions and treaties designed to prevent catastrophe</li>
                <li>Public alarm signaling urgent need for policy action</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Moving Backward (Further from Midnight) 🟢</h3>
            <p><strong>What it means:</strong> Positive actions reduce existential threats and increase survival prospects.</p>
            <p><strong>Positive indicators include:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Nuclear arms reduction treaties signed and implemented</li>
                <li>Meaningful progress on climate change mitigation</li>
                <li>International cooperation on regulating dangerous technologies</li>
                <li>Strengthened global institutions and conflict resolution mechanisms</li>
                <li>Improved information ecosystem combating disinformation</li>
                <li>Increased public and political will to address existential threats</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

            <!-- Current Threats -->
            <div class="info-section">
                <h2>Current Existential Threats (2024)</h2>
                
                <h3>1. Nuclear Weapons</h3>
                <p>Approximately 12,500 nuclear warheads exist globally. Russia's threats to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine, modernization programs in multiple nations, and breakdown of arms control agreements increase risks.</p>

                <h3>2. Climate Change</h3>
                <p>Global temperatures risen 1.1°C above pre-industrial levels. Current policies project 2.7°C warming by 2100, exceeding safe limits. Extreme weather events intensify, affecting food security and displacing millions.</p>

                <h3>3. Biological Threats</h3>
                <p>COVID-19 demonstrated pandemic vulnerability. Advances in synthetic biology enable creation of novel pathogens. Lack of global biodefense preparedness remains critical weakness.</p>

                <h3>4. Disruptive Technologies</h3>
                <p>Artificial intelligence development accelerates without adequate safety frameworks. Autonomous weapons systems, deepfake technology, and cyber warfare capabilities outpace regulatory responses.</p>

                <h3>5. Information Warfare</h3>
                <p>Systematic disinformation undermines science, democratic processes, and public health responses. Eroding trust in institutions hampers collective action on existential threats.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- What Can Be Done -->
            <div class="info-section">
                <h2>What Can Be Done?</h2>
                <p>While the Doomsday Clock reflects grave dangers, it also emphasizes that humanity has agency. Actions that could move the clock backward include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Nuclear:</strong> Resume arms control negotiations, reduce stockpiles, prevent proliferation, eliminate launch-on-warning policies</li>
                    <li><strong>Climate:</strong> Implement Paris Agreement pledges, transition to renewable energy, carbon pricing, protect ecosystems</li>
                    <li><strong>Technology:</strong> Develop AI safety standards, regulate autonomous weapons, strengthen biosafety protocols</li>
                    <li><strong>Information:</strong> Combat disinformation, promote media literacy, support quality journalism, strengthen democratic institutions</li>
                    <li><strong>International Cooperation:</strong> Strengthen UN and multilateral institutions, resolve conflicts diplomatically, invest in global health security</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Individual Action:</strong> Support science-based policies, vote for leaders committed to addressing existential risks, reduce personal carbon footprint, support organizations working on these issues, and stay informed.</p>
