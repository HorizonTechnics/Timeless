                    </div>

                    <h3>The Computer Revolution</h3>
                    <p>Early computers were room-sized machines used by governments and universities. The <strong>microprocessor</strong> (Intel 4004, 1971) miniaturized computing power. Personal computers emerged in the 1970s with the Altair 8800, Apple II, and Commodore 64. <strong>IBM PC (1981)</strong> established standards still used today.</p>
                    <p><strong>Apple Macintosh (1984)</strong> introduced graphical user interfaces (windows, icons, mouse) to the masses, making computers intuitive. <strong>Microsoft Windows</strong> dominated the PC market, while Apple cultivated creative professionals. Computing power doubled approximately every two years (Moore's Law), making today's smartphones more powerful than 1990s supercomputers.</p>

                    <h3>The Internet Revolution</h3>
                    <p>The Internet began as ARPANET (1969), a military research network. <strong>Tim Berners-Lee</strong> invented the World Wide Web (1989), creating protocols (HTTP), markup language (HTML), and the first browser. The Web made the Internet accessible to everyone, not just technical experts.</p>
                    <p>The <strong>Dot-com Boom</strong> (1995-2000) saw explosive growth as companies rushed online. Despite the subsequent crash, the Internet permanently transformed business, media, and society. <strong>Broadband</strong> replaced dial-up, enabling video streaming, online gaming, and cloud services. Today, 5+ billion people use the Internet - over 60% of humanity.</p>

                    <h3>Social Media Revolution</h3>
                    <p><strong>Facebook (2004)</strong> pioneered social networking at massive scale, now with 3+ billion users. <strong>YouTube (2005)</strong> democratized video content, hosting 500 hours of video uploaded every minute. <strong>Twitter/X (2006)</strong> created real-time global conversations. <strong>Instagram (2010)</strong> made photo-sharing universal. <strong>TikTok (2016)</strong> perfected short-form video.</p>
                    <p>Social media connects people globally but raises concerns about misinformation, mental health, privacy, and democracy. It amplifies both beneficial social movements and harmful conspiracy theories. Algorithms curate what we see, creating echo chambers and filter bubbles. Social media is perhaps the 21st century's most influential yet controversial technology.</p>

                    <h3>Mobile Revolution</h3>
                    <p><strong>iPhone (2007)</strong> combined phone, computer, camera, and music player with an intuitive touchscreen. It created the smartphone category, now with 6.8+ billion users globally. <strong>App stores</strong> created ecosystems of millions of applications for every imaginable purpose. <strong>Android</strong> (Google) provides an open-source alternative, now on 70% of smartphones.</p>
                    <p>Smartphones put powerful computers in billions of pockets, enabling mobile banking, navigation, communication, entertainment, and photography. They've transformed developing nations, providing Internet access without PC infrastructure. However, smartphone addiction, distraction, and mental health impacts are growing concerns.</p>

                    <h3>Cloud Computing</h3>
                    <p>Rather than storing data locally, cloud services (Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud) provide computing power and storage via the Internet. <strong>SaaS</strong> (Software as a Service) like Google Workspace and Microsoft 365 replaced installed software. Cloud gaming streams games without expensive hardware. Cloud technology enables AI, big data analytics, and the services we use daily.</p>

                    <h3>E-Commerce and the Gig Economy</h3>
                    <p><strong>Amazon (1994)</strong> revolutionized retail, starting with books and expanding to everything. E-commerce now represents 20%+ of retail sales. <strong>Alibaba</strong> dominates Asia. <strong>Shopify</strong> enables anyone to create online stores.</p>
                    <p>The <strong>gig economy</strong> - Uber, Airbnb, DoorDash, Upwork - allows people to monetize assets (cars, homes) and skills flexibly. This creates opportunities but also precarious employment without traditional benefits. Remote work, accelerated by COVID-19, demonstrates technology's power to reshape how and where we work.</p>

                    <h3>Artificial Intelligence</h3>
                    <p>AI has progressed from narrow applications to increasingly general capabilities. <strong>Machine learning</strong> enables systems to learn from data without explicit programming. <strong>Deep learning</strong> using neural networks powers image recognition, language translation, and recommendation algorithms.</p>
                    <p><strong>GPT models</strong> (ChatGPT, 2022) demonstrate AI's ability to generate human-like text, answer questions, write code, and assist creative work. <strong>Midjourney, DALL-E</strong> generate images from text descriptions. <strong>AlphaFold</strong> solved protein folding, a 50-year challenge. AI now drives cars, diagnoses diseases, plays games at superhuman levels, and assists research.</p>
                    <p>However, AI raises profound questions about job displacement, bias, privacy, misinformation, and existential risk. As AI approaches human-level intelligence, society must grapple with unprecedented ethical and safety challenges.</p>

                    <h3>Biotechnology and Medicine</h3>
                    <p><strong>CRISPR gene editing (2012)</strong> allows precise DNA modification, potentially curing genetic diseases and enhancing traits. <strong>mRNA vaccines</strong> (Pfizer, Moderna) proved revolutionary during COVID-19, adaptable to future pandemics. <strong>Personalized medicine</strong> tailors treatments to individual genetics.</p>
                    <p><strong>Synthetic biology</strong> engineers organisms for specific purposes - bacteria producing insulin, algae making biofuel. <strong>3D-printed organs</strong> may solve transplant shortages. <strong>Brain-computer interfaces</strong> (Neuralink) could restore mobility or enhance cognition. Biotechnology promises to extend lifespans, cure diseases, and perhaps transcend biological limitations.</p>

                    <h3>Robotics and Automation</h3>
                    <p>Robots increasingly perform dangerous, repetitive, or precision tasks. Manufacturing uses industrial robots extensively. <strong>Autonomous vehicles</strong> from Tesla, Waymo, and others are becoming mainstream. <strong>Drones</strong> deliver packages, monitor infrastructure, and assist agriculture.</p>
                    <p><strong>Boston Dynamics</strong> robots demonstrate remarkable mobility and dexterity. <strong>Surgical robots</strong> enable minimally invasive procedures. As robots grow more capable and AI more sophisticated, automation threatens to displace millions of jobs while creating new opportunities requiring different skills.</p>

                    <h3>Renewable Energy and Climate Tech</h3>
                    <p><strong>Solar panels</strong> are now cheaper than fossil fuels in many regions. <strong>Wind turbines</strong>, especially offshore, generate massive clean energy. <strong>Battery technology</strong> (lithium-ion and beyond) enables electric vehicles and grid storage. <strong>Nuclear fusion</strong> research (ITER, private ventures) pursues unlimited clean energy.</p>
                    <p><strong>Carbon capture</strong>, <strong>green hydrogen</strong>, and <strong>advanced materials</strong> offer paths to decarbonize industry. Climate technology is humanity's race against time to prevent catastrophic warming while powering modern civilization sustainably.</p>

                    <h3>Cryptocurrencies and Blockchain</h3>
                    <p><strong>Bitcoin (2009)</strong> introduced decentralized digital currency without banks or governments. <strong>Ethereum</strong> enabled smart contracts and decentralized applications. Thousands of cryptocurrencies now exist, with total market capitalizations in trillions.</p>
                    <p><strong>Blockchain</strong> technology promises transparent, tamper-proof record-keeping for supply chains, voting, and contracts. However, cryptocurrencies face criticism for volatility, scams, environmental impact (energy-intensive mining), and use in illegal activities. Their future role in finance remains hotly debated.</p>

                    <h3>Virtual and Augmented Reality</h3>
                    <p><strong>VR headsets</strong> (Meta Quest, PlayStation VR) create immersive experiences for gaming, training, and socializing. <strong>Augmented reality</strong> overlays digital information on the real world via smartphones or glasses (Apple Vision Pro). The <strong>"metaverse"</strong> concept envisions persistent virtual worlds for work, play, and social interaction.</p>
                    <p>VR/AR applications extend to education (virtual field trips), medicine (surgical training), architecture (building visualization), and therapy (exposure treatment for phobias). As technology improves and becomes affordable, virtual experiences may become as important as physical ones.</p>

                    <h3>Quantum Computing</h3>
                    <p>Quantum computers exploit quantum mechanics to perform calculations impossible for classical computers. <strong>Google's quantum supremacy</strong> claim (2019) demonstrated potential, though practical applications remain limited. <strong>IBM, Microsoft, and startups</strong> race to build scalable quantum computers.</p>
                    <p>Quantum computing promises breakthroughs in drug discovery, materials science, cryptography, and optimization. However, it also threatens current encryption, requiring quantum-resistant cryptography development. We're in quantum computing's early stages, analogous to classical computers in the 1950s.</p>

                    <h2>Challenges and Concerns</h2>
                    <p><strong>Privacy:</strong> Data collection by governments and corporations creates surveillance concerns. <strong>Cybersecurity:</strong> Hacking, ransomware, and cyber warfare threaten individuals, companies, and nations. <strong>Misinformation:</strong> Deepfakes and AI-generated content make truth harder to discern. <strong>Digital divide:</strong> Billions lack Internet access, exacerbating inequality. <strong>Addiction:</strong> Technology can be addictive, affecting mental health. <strong>Job displacement:</strong> Automation threatens employment. <strong>Environmental impact:</strong> Electronic waste, energy consumption, and rare earth mining create ecological harm.</p>

                    <h2>The Path Forward</h2>
                    <p>Technology's pace continues accelerating. Breakthroughs in AI, biotechnology, quantum computing, and energy reshape possibilities. However, technology is neither inherently good nor bad - its impact depends on how we develop and deploy it. Ensuring technology serves humanity requires thoughtful governance, ethical guidelines, equitable access, and vigilance against misuse. The coming decades will determine whether technology liberates humanity or creates new forms of control and inequality.</p>
