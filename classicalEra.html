                    <h2>The Classical World</h2>
                    <p>The Classical Era represents one of history's most influential periods, dominated by the civilizations of Ancient Greece and Rome. These societies created enduring legacies in philosophy, democracy, law, architecture, literature, and art that continue shaping Western civilization today. The intellectual and cultural achievements of this era laid foundations for modern thought, governance, and aesthetics.</p>

                    </div>

                    <h3>Ancient Greece (800-146 BCE)</h3>
                    <p>Greek civilization emerged from the "Dark Ages" following the Bronze Age collapse, developing into independent city-states (poleis) including Athens, Sparta, Corinth, and Thebes. Each polis had distinct governments, cultures, and identities, though all Greeks shared language, religion, and cultural practices.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Archaic Period (800-480 BCE):</strong> Greeks established colonies throughout the Mediterranean and Black Sea, spread their alphabet (adapted from Phoenician script), and conducted the first Olympic Games (776 BCE). Homer composed the Iliad and Odyssey, epic poems that defined Greek cultural identity. This period saw the rise of tyrannies and early democratic experiments.</p>

                    <p><strong>Classical Period (480-323 BCE):</strong> Athens emerged as the cultural and intellectual center after defeating Persia in the Greco-Persian Wars (499-449 BCE). Pericles led Athens during its Golden Age (461-429 BCE), commissioning the Parthenon and promoting democracy, arts, and philosophy. Athenian democracy allowed male citizens to participate directly in governance through the Assembly, though women, slaves, and foreigners were excluded.</p>

                    <h3>Philosophy and Science</h3>
                    <p>Greek philosophers revolutionized human thought. Socrates (470-399 BCE) pioneered the Socratic method of questioning, challenging Athenians to examine their beliefs. His student Plato (428-348 BCE) founded the Academy and wrote philosophical dialogues exploring justice, reality, and ideal governance in works like "The Republic." Plato's student Aristotle (384-322 BCE) studied virtually every subject - logic, ethics, politics, biology, physics - establishing scientific methodology and founding the Lyceum.</p>

                    <p>Pre-Socratic philosophers like Thales, Pythagoras, and Democritus sought natural explanations for phenomena previously attributed to gods. Greek scientists made remarkable discoveries: Hippocrates (c. 460-370 BCE) founded medical ethics and rational medicine; Euclid (c. 300 BCE) systematized geometry; Archimedes (287-212 BCE) pioneered physics and engineering; Eratosthenes (276-194 BCE) calculated Earth's circumference with remarkable accuracy.</p>

                    <h3>Greek Culture and Arts</h3>
                    <p>Greek theater originated in religious festivals honoring Dionysus. Tragedians Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides explored human nature, fate, and morality in plays still performed today. Aristophanes wrote satirical comedies critiquing Athenian society and politics.</p>

                    <p>Greek sculpture evolved from rigid Archaic forms to naturalistic Classical style capturing human anatomy and emotion. The Parthenon sculptures, Venus de Milo, and Laocoön exemplify Greek artistic achievement. Greek architecture developed the Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian orders, influencing Western architecture for millennia.</p>

                    <h3>Alexander the Great (356-323 BCE)</h3>
                    <p>Philip II of Macedon united Greek city-states under his rule. His son Alexander conquered the Persian Empire, Egypt, and reached India, creating history's largest empire by age 30. Alexander spread Greek culture throughout his conquests, beginning the Hellenistic Period where Greek culture merged with Eastern traditions. He founded over 20 cities named Alexandria, the most famous in Egypt becoming a center of learning housing the Great Library.</p>

                    <p>After Alexander's death, his empire fragmented into Hellenistic kingdoms ruled by his generals (the Diadochi). The Ptolemaic Kingdom in Egypt, Seleucid Empire in Persia, and Antigonid dynasty in Macedonia preserved and spread Greek culture until Roman conquest.</p>

                    </div>

                    <h3>The Roman Republic (509-27 BCE)</h3>
                    <p>According to legend, Rome was founded in 753 BCE by Romulus. After expelling their last king in 509 BCE, Romans established a republic with complex checks and balances. The Senate, composed of aristocratic patricians, advised elected magistrates including two consuls who shared executive power. Plebeians (common citizens) gradually gained rights through struggle, including the Twelve Tables (450 BCE), Rome's first written law code, and tribunes who could veto Senate decisions.</p>

                    <p>Rome expanded through military conquest and strategic alliances. The Punic Wars (264-146 BCE) against Carthage established Roman dominance in the western Mediterranean. Hannibal's brilliant invasion of Italy (218 BCE), including crossing the Alps with elephants, nearly destroyed Rome, but Scipio Africanus ultimately defeated him at Zama (202 BCE).</p>

                    <p>Republican expansion brought wealth but also inequality and political instability. Generals like Marius and Sulla used military loyalty to seize power. The First Triumvirate (60 BCE) - Julius Caesar, Pompey, and Crassus - dominated politics. Caesar's conquest of Gaul (58-50 BCE) made him immensely powerful. His crossing of the Rubicon River in 49 BCE triggered civil war. Despite achieving unprecedented power, Caesar was assassinated in 44 BCE by senators fearing monarchy.</p>

                    <h3>The Roman Empire (27 BCE - 476 CE)</h3>
                    <p>Octavian, Caesar's adopted heir, defeated Mark Antony and Cleopatra, becoming Rome's first emperor as Augustus (27 BCE). He maintained republican façade while consolidating power, beginning the Pax Romana (Roman Peace) lasting two centuries. The empire reached its greatest extent under Trajan (98-117 CE), stretching from Britain to Mesopotamia.</p>

                    <p>Rome's engineering achievements were extraordinary: roads spanning 400,000 kilometers connected the empire; aqueducts supplied cities with fresh water; concrete enabled massive structures like the Pantheon with its massive unreinforced concrete dome; the Colosseum (completed 80 CE) held 50,000 spectators for gladiatorial games.</p>

                    <h3>Roman Law and Administration</h3>
                    <p>Roman law evolved from the Twelve Tables into sophisticated legal principles still influencing modern legal systems. Concepts like "innocent until proven guilty," legal representation, and written contracts originated in Rome. The empire was divided into provinces governed by proconsuls or proprætors, with local administration often maintained under Roman oversight.</p>

                    <p>Roman citizenship conferred legal rights and protections. Initially restricted to Roman-born males, citizenship gradually extended throughout the empire. Emperor Caracalla granted citizenship to all free inhabitants in 212 CE, creating a unified legal identity across diverse cultures.</p>

                    <h3>Roman Culture and Daily Life</h3>
                    <p>Romans adopted and adapted Greek culture, creating Greco-Roman civilization. Latin literature flourished: Virgil's "Aeneid" mythologized Rome's founding; Ovid's "Metamorphoses" compiled Greek and Roman myths; Cicero's speeches and philosophical works shaped rhetoric; Seneca's Stoic philosophy influenced ethics.</p>

                    <p>Roman society was hierarchical: patricians (aristocrats), equestrians (wealthy business class), plebeians (common citizens), freedmen (former slaves), and slaves. Roman houses (domus) featured central courtyards, mosaics, and frescoes. Public baths served social and hygienic functions. Romans enjoyed theater, chariot races at circuses, and gladiatorial combats - brutal entertainment reflecting military culture.</p>

                    <h3>Christianity and the Late Empire</h3>
                    <p>Christianity emerged in the 1st century CE in Roman Judea with Jesus of Nazareth's teachings. Initially a Jewish sect, Christianity spread throughout the empire despite periodic persecutions. Paul of Tarsus was instrumental in spreading Christianity to Gentiles.</p>

                    <p>Emperor Constantine's conversion (312 CE) and the Edict of Milan (313 CE) legalized Christianity. Theodosius I made Christianity the state religion (380 CE), fundamentally transforming the empire. Christianity's monotheism and universal message appealed across ethnic and social boundaries.</p>

                    <h3>Decline and Fall</h3>
                    <p>The Crisis of the Third Century (235-284 CE) brought civil wars, economic collapse, and barbarian invasions. Emperor Diocletian (284-305 CE) divided the empire into Eastern and Western halves for better administration. Constantine founded Constantinople (330 CE) as the eastern capital.</p>

                    <p>The Western Roman Empire faced increasing Germanic invasions. Visigoths sacked Rome in 410 CE, shocking the Roman world. The last Western Roman Emperor, Romulus Augustulus, was deposed in 476 CE, traditionally marking the fall of the Western Roman Empire. The Eastern Roman Empire (Byzantine Empire) survived until 1453 CE.</p>

                    <h2>Legacy of the Classical Era</h2>
                    <p>The Classical Era's influence is immeasurable. Greek democracy and philosophy, Roman law and engineering, Latin language, and Greco-Roman art and architecture formed Western civilization's foundation. Modern governments, legal systems, architectural styles, and philosophical thought trace roots to this period. The Renaissance, Enlightenment, and modern democratic movements all looked to classical antiquity for inspiration.</p>
